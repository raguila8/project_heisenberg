        <p>
	        Project Heisenberg is a series of challenging physics problems 
          inspired by <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>. 
          The project is a platform for the curious mind to delve into the 
          world of physics and learn mathematical and physical concepts in a 
          fun and recrational way. The problems are aimed at students who 
          want to learn beyond their basic curriculum, anyone seeking to 
          understand the essential nature of the world and professionals who 
          want to keep their problem solving, physics and mathematics sharp.

	        Project Heisenberg allows you to track your progress through 
          achievement levels based on problems solved and their difficulty 
          level. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are easy, medium and hard problems represented by 1, 2
          or 3 stars respectively. Solving an easy problem earns you 20 points,
          medium problems give you 40 and hard problems are worth the most with
          80 points. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to your overall score, you can see how many 
          problems you have solved and your kudos score (obtained by writing
          helpful posts). Your progress page contains an in depth analytics 
          section where you can see how much of every branch and subtopic you 
          have completed.

            For each branch you can browse the list of problems and

            You will be able to see how many people have solved each problem 
            and what the success rate for solving the problem is. There is 
            also a difficulty rating system which may also help you decide 
            where to start. The problem difficulty determines how many

<h3 class="font-weight-600">Who are the problems aimed at?</h3>
<p>
	The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily physics but had an interest in physics, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and physics on the cutting edge.
</p>
<h3 class="font-weight-600">What next?</h3>
<p>
	In order to track your progress it is necessary to setup an account. If you already have an account then <a href=<%= new_user_session_path %>>Login</a>, otherwise please <a href=<%= signup_path %>>Register</a> â€“ it's completely free!
</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-600">Where to begin</h3>
<p>
	The Dashboard contains a list of the main physics branches including 
	<i>Classical Mechanics</i>, <i>Electromagnetism</i>, <i>Thermodynamics</i>, 
	<i>Quantum Mechanics</i> and <i>Special Relativity</i>. Once logged in, 
	you will be able to see how much of each branch you have completed.
</p>
<p>
	For each branch you can browse the list of problems and filter them 
	based on difficulty, topics for that particular branch and whether or 
	not you have solved the problem already. You will be able to see how 
	many people have solved each problem and what the success rate for 
	solving the problem is. There is also a difficulty rating 
	system which may also help you decide where to start. The problem 
	difficulty determines how many points a problem is worth. 
</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-600">Discusion Thread for Problems</h3>
<p>
	Each problem has its own thread where users can see how other users 
	have solved the problem, discuss methods, and share insights.
</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-600">Kudos</h3>
<p>
	The purpose of Kudos is to let the poster or other members know that you 
	found a particular post helpful, useful, or well written. You can see how
	many Kudos each person has in their progress page.
</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-600">Another way to Discuss and Meet Other Members</h3>
<p>
	You can add other users as friends and have private discussions with 
	them. They can also track their friends' progress by viewing 
	their progress page or comparing themselves with them through 
	the leaderboards page. 
</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-600">Reporting an Error</h3>
<p>
	With newly released problems it is possible that a small error may have
	slipped through the crack. If you want to report an error or think a problem
	is ambiguous and needs further clarification, you can contact us at
	projectheisenberg@gmail.com.
</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-600">New Problems</h3>
<p>
	There is an abundance of physics material already out there. Instead of 
	reinventing the wheel, Project Heisenberg strives to compile a grand 
	collection of existing physics challenges. New problems are posted every week.
