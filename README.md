# Project Heisenberg

Inspired by Project Euler, Project Heisenberg (named after theoretical physicist Werner Karl Heisenberg) is a website dedicated to a series of challenging physics problems. The project is a platform for the curious mind to delve into the world of physics and learn mathematical and physical concepts in a fun and recrational way. The problems are aimed at students who want to learn beyond their basic curriculum, anyone seeking to understand the essential nature of the world and proffessionals who want to keep their problem solving, physics and mathematics sharp.

Project Heisenberg allows users to track their progress through achievement levels based on problems solved and their difficulty level. In addition, users are able to track their friends' progress and discuss problems with them.

Each problem has its own discussion thread. You will be able to see how other members have solved the problem, discuss methods, and share your insights.
